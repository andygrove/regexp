# Regular Expression Test Utilities

Handy scripts for comparing regexp behavior between Java and cuDF.

Note to self:

- Edit `Main.java` and `test.py` to have the same test data
- `Main.java` is the baseline
- Experiment with the regexp pattern in `test.py` until both produce the same results
- Run `./run.sh` to see the results
